# CheckUp

**The Problem:** Adults, particularly young working professionals, frequently forgo seeking out care for their health because the process is often arduous and time-consuming. It takes significant effort to find the right kind of care and find a medical practitioner that meets your needs. 

**The Solution:** CheckUp exists to remove the burden of seeking medical care for adults by streamlining the process into a few simple clicks. As a virtual assistant CheckUp syncs with a user’s calendar availability and schedules appointments with care practitioners based on the user’s specific symptoms or medical needs. 

We used tools like React Native and Expo to build our high-fi prototype. To test our prototype, we used Xcode’s iPhone simulator and our personal devices. To use CheckUp, first download the Expo Go app on your iPhone. Then, you can scan the QR code below using the camera to open CheckUp in Expo Go.
